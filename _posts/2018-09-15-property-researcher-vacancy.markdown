- Communication: You will be expected to frequently contact Tareq (Head of Committee).
- Teamwork: You may work with others alongside Tareq and other volunteers.
- Experience of property searching

## Responsibilities
- Reports of potential properties in the area
- Take time to visit property with Tareq(Head of Committee)
