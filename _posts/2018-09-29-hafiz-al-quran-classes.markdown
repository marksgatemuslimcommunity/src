In order to further extend your child's knowledge, it is important to have
learned the Quran in it's entirety. While it takes a lifetime to achieve a base
understanding, the first step is learning the words of Allah and His
messengers. We plan to have these lessons soon start up. We do this for the
sake of Allah and our community growth and development. 

## Who can attend these lessons?
These classes are for children aged **10+**.

## When do these classes take place?
We start from **7am to 11am**. These sessions are for 4 hours every **Saturday**.

## What is the pricing on these lessons?
Alhamdulilah we only charge **£2 per hour** which is paid monthly at **£100 per month**.

## Where is the class being held?
61 Padnall Road
