## What are we looking for?
If you are passionate about writing specifically news stories, we would love to have you as part of our team. As we continue to grow, it is important to have events to meet other community members. Such events will be documented and updated on our website.

Please know that this is for the development of our Muslim community. There are no specific requirements as this is a voluntary position. We do however expect a level of:

- Communication: You will be expected to frequently contact Tareq (Head of Committee).
- Teamwork: You may work with others alongside Tareq and other volunteers.

## Responsibilities
- Cover events that we have
- Attend/participate events in order to document
