## When are the new times for Jummah?
The Bayan will now start at **12:45 PM** and the Jammah will begin at **1:15 PM**.
Please arrive early and conveniently to not interrupt the Khutbah. I recommend
arriving **10 minutes before** to avoid any disruption.

## What other community events are planned?
Alhamdulilah for those that noticed, we held a community gathering to allow
community members to directly communicate with committee members. This is
a chance to improve in areas that need development and interact with other
members of the community. We will now be having community gatherings regularly
to allow such discussions. We plan to have community gatherings every last
Friday of every month.

This will mean, for future community gatherings, the dates to meet are:

- 26th October
- 30th November
- 28th December
- ...etc and so on

We encourage all brothers to come and put forwards their ideas as well as being
open to discussions. We hope everyone takes time out of their busy schedules to
join us In-Sha-Allah.
