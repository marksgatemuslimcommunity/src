## What does this mean?
We will be phasing out the previously made Whatsapp group to be replaced with this service. I hope we will all use the website more often and stay up to date. In'Sha'Allah, the developer will be dedicated to keep everyone updated.

## I accidentally closed the newsletter banner, what should I do?
The web developer has made this accessible anytime using the "Newsletter" link in the navigation bar. We hope everyone subscribes to the newsletter. 

## Anything I need to know?
For emails being sent to the community, you may receive emails through the **Promotions** tab for Gmail. Please rest easy as these will be legitimate news from MGMC.
