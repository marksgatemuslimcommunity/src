In order to better manage the website and any news related to our community, the website developer has redesigned in hopes of it being used and referenced more. The main objective of the redesign is to cater mobile devices as well. We hope the website is clearer to use for any information you may seek.

## What other features have you addded?
In order to expand and have a collective team, we now have a **vacancy** section on the homepage. This will be used to advertise any volunteers who can take it upon themselves to take part.

We hope to continue development and keep the website as updated as possible.
