We are having a community gathering for those interested in finding a **property for a Masjid**. We are continuously growing as a community and the hall we currently book is not enough. We will be talking of objectives we need to achieve this. This includes other discussions such as:

- Fund raising
- Process of finding properties

We will have **free refreshments** for those willing to come. It is our duty to be part of this project. We hope to see all brothers.

This will be after our Jummah prayer so we hope you attend. The gathering will be from **2.00pm** to **2.30pm** If we run overtime, we would be happy to answer any further questions you may have.
