## MGMC for Serving the Community, working together:

The “Marks Gate Muslim Community” (MGMC) started its journey in 2013, by some local Muslim brother’s, for youth and adult to be actively engaging in faith, unity and worship. It is our belief that our primary concern should be to serve the needs of the local community and to work towards the common good. In recent years there has been noticeable improvement in Marks Gate in education, religious festivals and community cohesion. We are hoping a coming together of distinguished Muslims and non-Muslims to create Marks Gate’s first mosque in near future.


## Opposing Extremism and Promoting Tolerance:

The Marks Gate Muslim Community works actively to promote tolerance and understanding. Our Imams, community committee and workers encourage constructive engagement in society and rejection of extremism in all its forms. We advise worshipers to ensure they are registered to vote and take a part in local and national elections.


## Youth and Woman: Encouraging Participation

We are engaging youth in programmes of learning and recreating, dealing with issues of anti-social behaviour, hate crime, drugs, extremism and gang culture. Facilities are provided to allow woman to access relevant services in a culturally sensitive environment, including counselling service, special events and social support.
