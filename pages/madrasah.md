## What we do?
In order to educate future generations, we are currently teaching children in 
**Tajweed** and understanding of **Quran**. A member of our community has been
committed in teaching those children who are dedicated to learn.

Our Mualim has over 10 years experience and is DBS certified.

We provide education in multiple areas of our classes that extends from just learning how to read Quran.

## Why allow your child to attend?
It is important to take part in development of our local community. And in turn, you will have a chance to know other parents who are like-minded. This is a chance to grow and keep a close knit of parents together. Children also benefit from being with other students.

## How much does it cost?
In order to deal with administration and providing other resources, we do charge **per Child** however our pricing varies.
- <i class="fas fa-child"></i> One Child: £

## When do these classes take place?
