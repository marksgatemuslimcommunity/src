## What do we teach?
- Learning how to recite the Quran with Tajweed (Makhaarij/Sifaat-ul
Huroof/Ahkham Al-Tajweed)
- Memorisation of Surah from Quran/daily Quranic dua/Islamic Ahkam
- Islamic studies including Fiqh/'Aqeedah, stories of the Prophets and
  Seerah(the life of the Prophet Muhammad Sallalahu Alayhi Wa Salam).

## What is the purpose?
Our purpose is to establish a strong Madrasah educational institution for
future generations in Marks Gate In-Sha-Allah.

## Why allow your child to attend?
It is important to take part in development of our local community. And in turn, you will have a chance to know other parents who are like-minded. This is a chance to grow and keep a close knit of parents together. Children also benefit from being with other students.

## How much does it cost?
In order to deal with administration and providing other resources, we have a set pricing. In order to be affordable and benefit your children, we charge **Â£15.00 per week**.

## Can I see an overview of this term and the cost breakdown?
You can refer to [**this**]({% post_url 2018-09-17-timetable-and-costing %}) post for more information about the timetable as of 2018 as well cost breakdown.

## When do these classes take place?
